          <p>
            An allergic reaction is pollen, dust mites, molds, and pets are all
            common allergies that many suffer from. Occasionally, your body can
            mistakenly identify these as a threat. The body produces antibodies
            to try to fight off the threat and it is these antibodies that
            produce reactions. Depending on the allergen, you can have sneezing,
            swollen eyes, or a runny nose.

                    At Prana Health we preform skin prick testing on both
                    pediatric and adult patients. This is the most common
                    allergy test performed. This test is simple and safe with
                    results provided within 15-20 minutes. This will give you
                    the opportunity to receive a diagnosis and management plan
                    during your appointment.
