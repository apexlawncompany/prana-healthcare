      <p>Although the pandemic stage of COVID-19 has ended, coronavirus is still here. While most people who get the disease recover within a few weeks, some people experience symptoms long after that due to Long COVID. What is Long COVID and what should you do if you're not feeling well? Here's what to know.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>What is Long COVID?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Long COVID - officially called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) - occurs when COVID-19 symptoms continue even after the acute phase of the disease has passed. Long COVID symptoms can last for weeks or months and can have negative impacts on a person's physical and mental health.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Symptoms of Long COVID</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Symptoms differ from person to person, but common symptoms of long COVID include:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Chest pain</li>
        <li>Joint and muscle pain</li>
        <li>Difficulty concentrating or memory problems (brain fog)</li>
        <li>Anxiety and depression</li>
        <li>Chest pain or heart palpitations</li>
        <li>Loss of smell or taste</li>
        <li>Difficulty sleeping</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>These symptoms may require ongoing management, especially if they are severe. Even if you have recovered from COVID-19, you may still experience Long COVID symptoms.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Who is at Risk of Developing Long COVID?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>While scientists are still learning about Long COVID risk factors, they have found that some groups of people have a higher risk of developing Long COVID. These include people who had severe cases of COVID-19, especially people who were hospitalized; people with underlying health conditions, such as an autoimmune disease, asthma, diabetes, or obesity; people who experienced multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) during or after COVID-19; and people who did not get a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>What to Do If You Have Long COVID</h2>
      <br />
      <p>There is not yet a specific treatment for Long COVID, but your healthcare provider can work with you to create a personalized plan for managing symptoms[i]. When you talk to your health care provider, be sure to provide information like what symptoms you're experiencing and how often you experience them, when your symptoms started, what causes your symptoms to get worse, and how your symptoms affect your daily life.</p>
      <br />
      <p>There are also lab tests that may help your healthcare provider get a better understanding of your condition, such as a liver function test, complete blood count test, chest X-rays, and others depending on your specific symptoms.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Get a Long COVID Evaluation</h2>
      <br />
      <p>At Prana Health, our experienced team offers a full evaluation for Long COVID. We can also recommend treatment options and conduct long-term monitoring of Long COVID. Our Long COVID services include:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>

        <li>Neurocognitive testing on the computer to assess memory affected by COVID</li>
        <li>At-home sleep evaluation</li>
        <li>Nutritional counseling on Long COVID</li>
        <li>Physical therapy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Did you know that millions of adults in the U.S have obstructive sleep apnea? It's a common condition that can have big impacts on your sleep, health, and day-to-day life. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to address your OSA, and Prana Health is here to help.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>What is Sleep Apnea?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Sleep apnea is a <a href="/adult-sleep-disorders">sleep disorder</a> that causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start while you're sleeping. While there are several types of sleep apnea, the most common is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in which the upper airway repeatedly collapses while you sleep, causing breathing to stop and start. This occurs when the muscles that support soft tissues in your throat relax, causing your airway to momentarily narrow or close. Obstructive sleep apnea is a potentially serious disorder that can contribute to a variety of other health problems. OSA can affect anyone but is most common among older men and postmenopausal women.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Do I Have Obstructive Sleep Apnea?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>There are several symptoms to look for if you think you might have obstructive sleep apnea. These symptoms include:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Snoring loudly</li>
        <li>Breathing repeatedly stops while you sleep</li>
        <li>Gasping for air while sleeping</li>
        <li>Insomnia (difficulty staying asleep)</li>
        <li>Headache in the morning</li>
        <li>Dry mouth in the morning</li>
        <li>Hypersomnia (excessive daytime drowsiness)</li>
        <li>Irritability</li>
        <li>Trouble paying attention while awake</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Keep in mind that another type of sleep apnea - central sleep apnea - can also have these symptoms. A sleep specialist can help determine if you have sleep apnea, and if so, which type.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Why is Sleep Apnea an Issue?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Obstructive sleep apnea can cause a number of issues that impact your health and everyday life. Disrupted sleeping at night can make you feel sleepy, fatigued, and irritable during the day, which can negatively impact your quality of life. You may notice that it's harder to concentrate during the day, your memory is impacted, and you're not as productive.</p>
      <br />
      <p>OSA causes blood oxygen levels to suddenly drop, which increases blood pressure. This strain on the cardiovascular system can have long-term consequences if left untreated. Obstructive sleep apnea is closely linked to cardiovascular issues like hypertension, irregular heartbeat, and increased risk of heart attack and stroke.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Additionally, OSA has been linked to metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, abnormal cholesterol, liver problems, and more.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>What to do if You Have Sleep Apnea</h2>
      <br />
      <p>If you think you might have sleep apnea, it's important to talk to a doctor or sleep specialist. They'll be able to recommend next steps for you, such as participating in a sleep study and making lifestyle changes. Adjusting your sleep position, avoiding alcohol and sedatives before bedtime, and managing your weight may help alleviate some symptoms of sleep apnea.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Prana Health Can Help</h2>
      <br />
      <p>At Prana Health, we specialize in sleep disorders and treatments, including OSA and CPAP therapy.

      <p>Depression is a common mental disorder that affects hundreds of millions of people around the world. 1 In addition to impacting mental health, depression may cause physical pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, changes in appetite, and more, so it's important lower your risk of developing depression. 2 Here are 10 habits to incorporate into your routine to help reduce your risk of depression.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>1. Eat Nutritious Food</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Following a healthy diet may reduce the risk of developing clinical depression or depressive symptoms. This is especially true when the diet incorporates fruits and vegetables and avoids junk food and food that causes inflammation.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>2. Exercise Regularly</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Exercise releases endorphins - natural chemicals in the brain that improve your sense of well- being - which may help reduce anxiety and depression. Exercising also allows you to give your mind a break from the things that are bothering you or causing negative thoughts, providing a healthy way to cope with anxiety and depression.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>3. Get Enough Rest</h2>
      <br />
      <p>The amount and quality of sleep you get at night impacts how you feel and function during the day. People with insomnia, for example, may be more likely to develop depression than people who sleep well at night. 5 Alternatively, healthy sleep reduced the risk of depression by 22% in a recent study.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>4. Be Less Sedentary/h2>
      <br />
      <p>Being sedentary for long periods of time can put you at risk of developing depression, even if you get exercise every day. 6 Find ways to get more movement in your day, such as taking breaks from spending time in front of screens and standing instead of sitting when possible.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>5. Make Time for Friends and Family</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Frequent social connection decreased the risk of depression by 18% in a recent study. People who feel connected to others also have more empathy for other people and higher self-esteem. Be sure to make time for friends and family and cultivate social connection.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>6. Limit Alcohol</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Large quantities of alcohol may cause depression during intoxication and anxiety during withdrawal or hangover. The more alcohol you drink and the more frequently you drink, the more likely you are to develop temporary anxiety and depressive symptoms. Reducing your alcohol intake can help reduce your risk of depression.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>7. Don't Smoke</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Like alcohol, smoking increases a person's risk of depression. The more you smoke and the more frequently you smoke, the higher your risk of depression. If you smoke regularly, consider quitting to improve your mental health.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>8. Manage Stress</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Stress is a natural reaction, but too much stress can increase your risk of depression and anxiety, as well as muscle tension, digestive issues, high blood pressure, heart attack, sleep problems, and more. Try to identify what's causing the stress and develop healthy coping strategies, such as getting enough sleep, building strong relationships, and seeking help from a professional.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>9. Reduce Screen Time</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Screens have become part of our daily lives, and growing evidence shows that social media can cause depression and anxiety or make these issues worse. Try to reduce your screen time, such as by scheduling breaks or turning off notifications on your devices so you feel less tempted to check them.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>10. Talk to a Professional</h2>
      <br />
      <p>You don't have to deal with depression alone. A mental health professional can work with you to determine the best treatment methods for your depression. Talking to a professional is an important step in feeling better.</p>
      <br />

    <p>Getting a good night's sleep is incredibly important, especially if you're pregnant. Sleep deprivation during pregnancy may lead to longer labor as well as more discomfort and pain during labor and higher rates of preterm labor and cesarean section. Sleep struggles are a common occurrence during pregnancy. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to improve your sleep, and Prana Health is here to help.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>First Trimester</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Progesterone levels increase during the first trimester of pregnancy, which can make you feel more tired or fatigued than usual. Naps may become a frequent occurrence. Although you might feel sleepier during the day and go to bed earlier than you used to, you may find yourself feeling restless at night. Nausea and vomiting can disrupt your sleep, and the increasing pressure on your bladder can lead to nighttime trips to the bathroom.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Second Trimester</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Sleep quality often improves during the second trimester, leaving you feeling more energized than you felt during the first trimester. However, as your baby bump gets larger, you may find yourself having to find different sleeping positions to stay comfortable, such as sleeping on your side. Heartburn and indigestion can also occur, making sleeping difficult. Additionally, you may still experience strange pregnancy dreams.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Third Trimester</h2>
    <br />
    <p>The third trimester features a variety of sleep disturbances, including the tiredness and frequent trips to the bathroom that you might deal with during the first trimester. As your growing baby presses against your insides, the additional weight and pressure can cause shortness of breath, leg cramps, and backaches that disrupt your sleep. Restless leg syndrome can also occur during pregnancy, resulting in uncomfortable sensations in the legs that may worsen at night. You may also experience heartburn, achy joints, fetal movement, and other discomfort. Laying on your side may help you sleep more comfortably and allow proper blood flow. Obstructive sleep apnea, which is caused by the upper airway collapsing repetitively while you sleep and negatively impacting your breathing, can also occur.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Sleep and Mental Health</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Sleep and mental health are closely linked. Getting poor quality sleep or not enough sleep can negatively affect your mental health. Additionally, poor mental health can make it harder to sleep, creating a vicious cycle. The anticipation of birth and motherhood can also cause stress, anxiety, and insomnia. If you're not getting quality sleep and/or you have symptoms of anxiety and depression, be sure to talk to a mental health professional.</p>
    <br />

    <p>A good night's sleep is extremely important for our overall health and well-being. However, a variety of factors can impact the quality of our sleep, including hormone levels. Sex hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, play a significant role in regulating our sleep patterns. In this blog post, we'll explore how sex hormones can affect your sleep, and what you can do to treat sleep issues.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Estrogen and Sleep</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Estrogen is a hormone that primarily affects women, but it's also present in smaller quantities in men. It plays a crucial role in regulating the female reproductive system, and it impacts sleep patterns as well. During the menstrual cycle, estrogen levels fluctuate, which can lead to changes in sleep quality.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Some research has shown that estrogen may improve the overall quality of sleep. Estrogen helps keep your body cooler at night, which contributes to better sleep. Healthy women typically have better quality of sleep than healthy men, including longer Rapid Eye Movement (REM) latency, less time awake during the night, longer deep sleep, and longer total sleep time. It's believed that sex hormones play a role.</p>
    <br />
    <p>When estrogen levels decrease, such as during menopause, sleep disturbances can occur. This may include hot flashes and night sweats, making it harder to get a good night's sleep.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Testosterone and Sleep</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone, but it also exists in smaller amounts in females. Testosterone levels typically peak during early adulthood and slowly decrease as you get older. When testosterone levels decrease, it can lead to sleep problems in men as well as women. Low testosterone levels have been associated with reduced sleep quality, increased sleepiness during the day, and disrupted sleep patterns.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Hormone Replacement Therapy</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a common medical intervention used to address hormone imbalances in men and women. HRT can be beneficial in alleviating sleep disturbances associated with hormone fluctuations, such as those experienced during menopause or andropause. Studies have suggested that HRT can improve sleep quality by stabilizing hormone levels, reducing hot flashes, and alleviating insomnia.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Why is Quality Sleep So Important?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>High-quality sleep offers a wide range of benefits. It can reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other serious health issues. It can also improve your mood, reduce stress, and help you think more clearly. Getting enough quality sleep can also help you make good decisions and avoid accidents and injuries. High-quality sleep is crucial to your overall health and well-being.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Struggling with Sleep Issues? We Can Help.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>If you're regularly struggling to get a good night's sleep, it's time to find a solution. At Prana Health, we address a variety of <a href="/adult-sleep-disorders">sleep issues</a>, including insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and other sleep disorders.

    <p>How often do you breathe through your mouth instead of your nose? Chronic mouth breathers can experience a variety of side effects, including sleep disorders, health issues, and yes, even facial changes. Fortunately, there are many ways to treat mouth breathing to help you sleep well and look your best.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>What Is Mouth Breathing? Why Is It a Problem?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Mouth breathing occurs when you inhale through your mouth instead of your nose. This negatively impacts the quality of air you get when you inhale. Since air isn't passing through the nose, you don't get the filtration benefits that the nose provides via the cilia - tiny hairs in your nose that filter out allergens, pollution, and other debris.</p>
    <br />
    <p>People who often breathe through their mouths are also more susceptible to health concerns like impaired lung function, digestion troubles, and sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Additionally, mouth breathing can affect the shape of your face. Mouth breathing impacts the development of your facial structure, especially if you start mouth breathing as a child. It can cause your face to become long and narrow without proper room for your tongue or your teeth.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>How Does Mouth Breathing Affect Your Face?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
    When you breathe through your nose, your tongue places pressure on the palate, and this
    pressure encourages forward jawbone growth. When you breathe through your mouth, your
    tongue does not place pressure on the palate, and this lack of pressure allows the facial muscles
    to force down the top jaw, causing it to elongate. The bottom jaw may also grow in smaller
    than normal. Teeth may become crowded, and the chin may recede.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
    These facial changes not only affect how the face looks, but also constricts air passageways,
    which can negatively impact sleep. Sleep loss increases your risk of depression, obesity, and
    hypertension. Mouth breathing can also cause sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apnea, and other
    sleep disorders.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
    Additionally, mouth breathers are more likely to have poor posture than nose breathers,
    leading to headaches, muscle tension, and irregular balance. You may also experience dry
    mouth, bad breath, and drool on your pillow.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Is Mouth Breathing Treatable?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
    The negative effects of mouth breathing are extensive. Fortunately, there are steps you can
    take to address the issue. It's important to figure out why you're breathing through your mouth
    in the first place. Common causes include enlarged tonsils, enlarged adenoids, a deviated
    septum, and a chronic stuffy nose. Talking to a doctor is a great way to learn more about mouth
    breathing, discover why you're breathing through your mouth, and determine solutions.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
    If the issue is enlarged adenoids or a deviated septum, you may need surgery to correct the
    problem. If the issue is sleep apnea, you may need to make lifestyle changes, such as losing
    weight, treating allergies, and sleeping on your side.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
    Although you may not see drastic physical changes when you correct your mouth breathing
    habit, especially if you've been doing so since you were a kid, you can still benefit from
    improved posture, which can improve your overall appearance, including your face. With
    improved breathing, you may also sleep better and experience improved health overall.
    Treating your mouth breathing issue can also help you achieve fewer dark circles under the
    eyes, clearer eyes, and a generally more energized appearance.
